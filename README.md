OVERVIEW that we were given:

The Connected Office Initiative (COI) encapsulates the use of IoT devices within the network,
placed all over the office building, to collect and share the data that these devices gather. The
data can be shared in different ways. One of which is through visualisations built into a report or
dashboard. These reports or dashboards can be shared with different stakeholders, potentially
with different levels of access applied. The COI have been advised that a good way to monitor
the usage of their IoT devices would be through a report.
The report will be built in Power BI, as the organisation already has all applicable licensing
agreements in place with Microsoft, and the report is expected to allow all stakeholders to see the
same information pertaining to the status of IoT device registrations on various platforms. As a
member of the COI development team, you are expected to acquire and practise the necessary
skills to create such a report.
